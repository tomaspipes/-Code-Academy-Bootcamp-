# JavaBank

An unofficial roadmap of the skills I learned during this major project.

✔️ User Interface
PromptView: terminal interface, input/output streams, scanners, etc.

HTML5 && CSS: Bootstrap, flexbox, etc. Thymeleaf: dynamic templating

✔️ Design Patterns

• Factory (used in JavaBank)

• Strategy (used in JavaBank)

• State (state machine of TCP handshake)

• Builder (StringBuilder pattern)

• Observer

• Singleton (used by Spring in bean creation)

• Decorator (used by BufferedReader())

• These are some examples and what context they were mentioned during the bootcamp.

✔️ MVC and Service Layer
Architectural pattern, separation of responsability, layer pattern.

✔️ Maven
Replaced build.xml + ANT command. Project and dependency manager + build tool.

✔️ Tests
TDD, JUnit (unit testing), Mockito.

✔️ Databases
MySQL, Relational Databases, ACID, Database Normalization.

✔️ JDBC
Java Database Connector

✔️ JPA
ORM, Hibernate, Annotation Mappings, Criteria Queries, JPQL.

✔️ Enterprise Application
JavaEE, Data Access Objects, Transactions, Three Tier Architecture.

✔️ Spring
Dependency Injection, XML defined beans, AOP.

✔️ Java Web
JSP, Servlets, Web Container (Tomcat), web descriptor (web.xml)

✔️ SpringMVC
Annotation defined beans, Front Controller pattern, thymeleaf view resolver, autowiring.

DTO: Data Transfer Objects - not related to Spring but applied during this phase.

✔️ REST
Web service, uses HTTP protocol, JSON, postman for testing.

✔️ JS Web Development
DOM API, AJAX, JQuery, dev tools for testing.
